        <p>I am Bridger Norman, I hail from the exotic land of Sugar City Idaho, 
            and made the perilous 10 minute journey to attend school here in Rexburg.
            I have been married to my lovely wife Ellise for two years now 
        </p>
        <p>
            I am a Data Science Major and have 2 semesters left until I graduate.
            Wether I end up in an analyst or engineer job I hope to one day be utilizing machine learning in my work. 
            A personal aspiration that I have always had is to become a published author.
